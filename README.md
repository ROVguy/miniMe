# miniMe

I’m resurrecting miniMe. New wiring, new mode of communication, a few other new things. Same 14-year-old robot(Original design ~2009).
Repository: Code snippet examples and everything that will be used on miniMe.

Find examples that cover areas of interest: Ethernet Arduino, Arduino ROS, ROSserial, motor driving algo, servo driving algo, biped balancing, learning algo, Python C++…

Setup ROS to communicate over ethernet to multiple Arduino’s.

Each Arduino responsible for position and feedback of 2 DC motors/joints.
Feedback generated by potentiometer, motor control done using H-Bridge controller.

Setup simple keyboard interface for moving joints.
Setup PS (or other) controller for improved movements.

Huge step later self-balancing without being kicked or pushed. How rude!

Maybe one day walk?
